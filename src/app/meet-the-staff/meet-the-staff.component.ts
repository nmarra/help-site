      name: 'Stephanie Powell, Executive Director',
      bio: 'Stephanie is a PATH International Registered Therapeutic Riding Instructor, Certified Equine Specialist in Mental Health and Learning, and  a Certified  Special Olympics Equestrian Coach. Starting  at a young age she caught the horse-loving bug. Her riding education began early and continued with over 8 years of hunter/jumper lessons in Manor, Texas, including show experience in TSSA, CenTex, and CTHJA.  Combining her love for horses and helping others, she became involved in therapeutic riding. This led to opportunities to work with at-risk youth, Horses for Heroes, summer camps, and a chemical dependency program.  With a passion for  partnering horses with humans and a focus on horsemanship, her teaching style encourages  the connection between horse and rider from the very beginning.  Her herd includes an 18-year-old thoroughbred gelding  named Pencil and a cat.'
