  <h2>Volunteer Orientation</h2>
  <p>We hold Volunteer Orientation once a month at HELP, typically the 3rd Saturday of the month from 1:30-4p. You do not need to attend a VO before you begin volunteering but it's a great way to learn about our programs and volunteer opportunities! Email us today to confirm the next VO session and to sign up to attend.</p>

  <p>For those of you ready to start volunteering, our volunteer application is available for download <a href="/HELP_Volunteer_Form.docx">here</a>. Please do not email your application, bring it with you to your appointment.</p>
